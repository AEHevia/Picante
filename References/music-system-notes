Music System : Flow Picante

Once the input is received, the system needs to be able to output midi data live that can be interpreted as music. 
To do this it will need to be able to process, or seemingly process, harmony, rhythm, and melody, which are the basic components of music.
Within the context of the system, I believe that there should be different threads handling these components for robustness, and
I believe the modularity will work to reduce complexity. 

Here is a breakdown of the music components, where melody/harmonics is taking the sensor data and choosing what to do with it
